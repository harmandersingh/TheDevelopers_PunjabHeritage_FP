		  <h1>Punjab Heritage </h1>
		  <p>
		   Punjab has a long history and rich cultural heritage. Artifacts dating back to the Pleistocene Age have been found in the valley of Kangra, Pehalgam, and Hoshiarpur. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidences of the magnificent, 5000 years old, Harappan culture that flourished in Punjab.
			The Vedic and the later Epic periods of the Punjab were socially and culturally the most creative. During this period, a number of learning and culture centres were established. During the advent of Buddhism Punjab became a cultural crossroad. Throughout the ages Punjab was a crucible of culture and blending of many communities and cultures resulted in moulding up a culture with a utilitarian outlook on life. <br>
			<br>
			Punjab is not only profess and practice hospitality in their own land but also carry it, untainted and virgin, to the lands where they immigrate. There is no country in the world where Punjabis have not created waves.
			<br></br>
			<b>Punjab</b> is a well-known state in India that is located at the northwest end of the country. This state has gained recognition as the <b>'land of five rivers'.</b> The five rivers are Sutlej, Ravi, Beas, Chenab and Jhelum. The state of Punjab acts as a clear demarcation of India from the neighbouring country Pakistan. The major cities that form an integral part of the state include <b>Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Bathinda</b> and <b>Anandpur Sahib.</b> Apart from the aforementioned cities, Kapurthala, Tarn Taran Sahib and Patiala also are situated in the state of Punjab. This state is primarily agriculture-based due to the presence of abundant water sources and fertile soils.<br>
			It is bounded on its north by the Indian state of <b>Jammu &amp; Kashmir,</b> on its east by Himachal Pradesh and the Union territory of <b>Chandigarh,</b> on its south by Haryana and Rajasthan, and on its west by Pakistan. The city of Chandigarh is the joint administrative capital of Punjab and Haryana.
